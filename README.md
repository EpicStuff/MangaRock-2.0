The spiritual successor to MangaRock  
MangaRock 2.0 is a program inspired by the original MangaRock that not only keeps track of a list of "works" but also scrapes and calculates the number of new chapters.  
is basically just a worse web version of tachiyomi, i think, since i don't have an android or id just be using that instead

why is there no documentation/why it sucks?: cuz the only person that (probably) ever going to use this is me so there's no point
