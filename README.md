# MangaRock 2.0

The spiritual successor to MangaRock

MangaRock 2.0 is a program inspired by the original MangaRock that not only keeps track of a list of "works" but also scrapes and calculates the number of new chapters.

is basically just a worse web version of tachiyomi. i think, since i don't have an android or id just be using that instead.
If you can get a virtual machine setup, this also allows cross device syncing stuff.

**why is there no documentation/why it sucks?**: cuz the only person that (probably) ever going to see this is me so there's no point.
If by any chance there is someone interested in using this, make an issue or something and I'll write up some docs.
