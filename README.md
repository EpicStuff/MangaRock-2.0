The spiritual successor to MangaRock  
MangaRock 2.0 is a program inspired by the original MangaRock that not only keeps track of a list of "works" but also scrapes and calculates the number of new chapters.  
All features and basic usage can be found in Features.txt (outdated)

currently working on rewrite, checkout the v3 branch, it runs atleast

license: pls don't just copy and stuff
