# MangaRock 2.0

The spiritual successor to MangaRock  
MangaRock 2.0 is a program inspired by the original MangaRock that not only keeps track of a list of "works" but also scrapes and calculates the number of new chapters.  
is basically just a worse web version of tachiyomi, i think, since i don't have an android or id just be using that instead.

why is there no documentation/why it sucks?: cuz the only person that (probably) ever going to see this is me so there's no point.
I by any change there is someone intressed in using this, make an issue or something and I'll write up some docs.
