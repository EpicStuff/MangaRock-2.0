The spiritual successor to MangaRock  
MangaRock 2.0 is a program inspired by the original MangaRock that not only keeps track of a list of "works" but also the number of new chapters.  
All features and basic usage can be found in Features.txt (outdated)

currently working on rewrite, hope to move away from tkinter to web based

license: pls don't just copy and stuff
